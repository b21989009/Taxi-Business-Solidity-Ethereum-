Shared Taxi Business - a Smart Contract - draft to run on Ethereum BlockChain.


Imagine a group of people in the same neighborhood who would like to invest into an asset. They cannot invest individually because each person has a very small amount of money, thus they can combine their holdings together to invest into a bigger and more profitable investment.
They decided to combine their money and buy a car which will be used as a taxi and the profit will be shared among participants every month. However, one problem is that they have no trust in each other. 

As a solution, a smart contract will handle a common asset and distribution of income generated from this asset (a taxi) in certain time intervals.
